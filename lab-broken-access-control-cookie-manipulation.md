# Lab: Broken access control - cookie manipulation

**Broken Access Control combined with Cookie Manipulation** occurs when an application trusts client-side data (such as cookies) to make authorization decisions. By modifying cookie values, an attacker may bypass access restrictions, escalate privileges, or access resources belonging to other users. This often results from missing server-side authorization checks or insecure session handling.

# Authentication vulnerabilities - Lab: Username enumeration via different responses

1. With Burp running, investigate the login page and submit an invalid username and password.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and find the `POST /login` request. Highlight the value of the `username` parameter in the request and send it to Burp Intruder.
3. In Burp Intruder, notice that the `username` parameter is automatically set as a payload position. This position is indicated by two `§` symbols, for example: `username=§invalid-username§`. Leave the password as any static value for now.
4. Make sure that **Sniper attack** is selected.
5. In the **Payloads** side panel, make sure that the **Simple list** payload type is selected.
6. Under **Payload configuration**, paste the list of candidate usernames. Finally, click **Start attack**. The attack will start in a new window.
7. When the attack is finished, examine the **Length** column in the results table. You can click on the column header to sort the results. Notice that one of the entries is longer than the others. Compare the response to this payload with the other responses. Notice that other responses contain the message `Invalid username`, but this response says `Incorrect password`. Make a note of the username in the **Payload** column.
8.  Close the attack and go back to the **Intruder** tab. Click **Clear §**, then change the `username` parameter to the username you just identified. Add a payload position to the `password` parameter. The result should look something like this:

    `username=identified-user&password=§invalid-password§`
9. In the **Payloads** side panel, clear the list of usernames and replace it with the list of candidate passwords. Click **Start attack**.
10. When the attack is finished, look at the **Status** column. Notice that each request received a response with a `200` status code except for one, which got a `302` response. This suggests that the login attempt was successful - make a note of the password in the **Payload** column.

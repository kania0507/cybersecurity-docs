# Pentesting Fundamentals

Pentesting is about finding vulnerabilities in a system or application _with permission_.

A penetration test simulates the tools and methods used by malicious attackers — but in a lawful, ethical way. Think of it as a security audit with report of weak points.

Before starting, testers and clients define the **scope**, **tools**, and **techniques**. This is documented in a **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** agreement. Ethical dilemmas are common — such as accessing sensitive data during tests — and that’s where individual judgment and clearly defined permissions matter.

**Types of Hackers:**

Hat Type Description White Hat Works legally and ethically. Example: Authorized pentester. Grey Hat May help, but breaks laws or ethics in the process. Example: Taking down scam sites. Black Hat Malicious intent. Example: Ransomware authors.

**Rules of Engagement (ROE)** includes:

* **Permission**: Legal clearance to test.
* **Test Scope**: What can and can’t be tested.
* **Rules**: Techniques that are allowed or forbidden.

Q: You are given permission to perform a security audit on an organisation; what type of hacker would you be?\
A: White Hat

Q: You attack an organisation and steal their data, what type of hacker would you be?\
A: Black Hat

Q: What document defines how a penetration testing engagement should be carried out?\
A: Rules of Engagement

Every pentest is different. The approach is shaped by the **scope**, **target**, and **goal**. Methodologies guide how penetration testers work through the engagement. Common stages include:

Stage Description Information Gathering Publicly accessible data collection (e.g., OSINT). Enumeration/Scanning Identifying services or applications on target systems. Exploitation Using vulnerabilities to gain initial access. Privilege Escalation Expanding access (horizontally or vertically). Post-Exploitation Pivoting, data collection, covering tracks, reporting.

**Frameworks:**

* OSSTMM

Focus: Networks, systems, telecommunications\
Pros: Deep coverage, flexible\
Cons: Dense, hard to understand

* OWASP

Focus: Web apps\
Pros: Clear, up-to-date, great for developers\
Cons: No official accreditation

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Focus: Improving organizational security\
Pros: Widely used, very detailed\
Cons: Not pentest-focused, weak auditing, lacks cloud focus

* NCSC CAF

Focus: National infrastructure\
Pros: Backed by government, 14 principles\
Cons: New, principle-based (not rules), slow adoption

Q: What stage of penetration testing involves using publicly available information?\
A: Information Gathering

Q: If you wanted to use a framework for pentesting telecommunications, what framework would you use?\
A: OSSTMM

Q: What framework focuses on the testing of web applications?\
A: OWASP



Black-Box

* No internal knowledge
* Acts like an outsider
* High effort in enumeration
* Time-consuming

Grey-box

* Some internal knowledge
* Balance between realism and efficiency
* Most commonly used in practice

White-Box

* Full access to source and system
* Requires deep technical understanding
* Great for internal QA teams
* Thorough but time-heavy

Q: You are asked to test an application but are not given access to its source code — what testing process is this?\
A: Black Box

Q: You are asked to test a website, and you are given access to the source code — what testing process is this?\
A: White Box

Q: Complete the penetration test engagement against ACME’s infrastructure.\
A: `THM{PENTEST_COMPLETE}`
